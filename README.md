## My process

  

### Built with

  

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS custom properties

- Flexbox

- Media queries

  
  

### What I learned

  

With the previous challenges being somewhat simpler, and lack of experience, I hadn't really encountered a need to try and think about the responsiveness of my layouts before. So I learned how to use media queries as well as styling of elements I haven't had to deal with as of yet, including hr, tables and more in-depth list styling.

  

### Continued development

  

Going forward I want to improve my knowledge on how best to build a layout that will translate onto mobile and smaller screen sizes more effectively.

  
  
  

### Useful resources

  

- [A practical guide to responsive web design](https://youtu.be/x4u1yp3Msao?si=AoFX6iRYvxKGc9Hq) this helped ascertain better knowledge on how to implement responiveness, however only looked into this after running into problems when I thought I was finished and finally checked mobile screen size.
